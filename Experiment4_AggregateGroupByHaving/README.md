# Experiment 4: Aggregate Functions, Group By and Having Clause

## AIM
To study and implement aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clause with suitable examples.

## THEORY

### Aggregate Functions
These perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- **MIN()** – Smallest value  
- **MAX()** – Largest value  
- **COUNT()** – Number of rows  
- **SUM()** – Total of values  
- **AVG()** – Average of values

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### GROUP BY
Groups records with the same values in specified columns.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```
### HAVING
Filters the grouped records based on aggregate conditions.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;
```

**Question 1**
--
-- Write a SQL query to determine the number of customers who received at least one grade for their activity.

Sample table: customer

| customer_id | cust_name     | city        | grade | salesman_id |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 3002        | Nick Rimando  | New York    | 100   | 5001        |
| 3007        | Brad Davis    | New York    | 200   | 5001        |
| 3005        | Graham Zusi   | California  | 200   | 5002        |


 

```
select count(grade) as COUNT from customer;
```

**Question 2**
---
-- Write a SQL query to find the maximum purchase amount.

Sample table: orders

| 70001  | 150.5     | 2012-10-05  | 3005        | 5002        |
| 70009  | 270.65    | 2012-09-10  | 3001        | 5005        |
| 70002  | 65.26     | 2012-10-05  | 3002        | 5001        |



```
select max(purch_amt) as MAXIMUM from orders;
```

**Output:**

**Question 3**
---
-- Write a SQL query to calculate total purchase amount of all orders. Return total purchase amount.

Sample table: orders

|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 70001  | 150.5     | 2012-10-05  | 3005        | 5002        |
| 70009  | 270.65    | 2012-09-10  | 3001        | 5005        |
| 70002  | 65.26     | 2012-10-05  | 3002        | 5001        |


```
select sum(purch_amt) as TOTAL from orders;
```

**Output:**

**Question 4**
---
--Write a SQL Query to find how many medications are prescribed for each patient?

```
select PatientId , count(Medications) as AvgMedications from MedicalRecords group by PatientId;
```

**Output:**

**Question 5**
---
-- What is the total number of medications prescribed for each patient?

Sample table:Prescriptions Table

```
select PatientId , count(Medication) as TotalMedications from Prescriptions group by PatientId;
```

**Output:**
