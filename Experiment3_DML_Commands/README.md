# Experiment 3: DML Commands

## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
**Syntax (Single Row):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
**Syntax (Multiple Rows):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
**Syntax (Insert from another table):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
**Syntax (All rows):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**Syntax (Specific condition):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Question 1**
--
--Write a SQL query to Delete customers from 'customer' table where 'AGENT_CODE' is either 'A003' or 'A008'.

```
delete from customer where AGENT_CODE = 'A003' or AGENT_CODE = 'A008';
```

**Question 2**
---
-- Write a SQL query to Delete customers from 'customer' table where 'CUST_NAME' contains the substring 'Holmes'.

**Question 3**
---
--Write a SQL query to classify base in the Calculations table as 'Provided' if it is not NULL, otherwise 'Not Provided'.

cid         name        type        notnull     dflt_value  pk
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
0           id          INTEGER     0                       1
1           value1      REAL        0                       0
2           value2      REAL        0                       0
3           base        INTEGER     0                       0
4           exponent    INTEGER     0                       0
5           number      REAL        0                       0
6           decimal     REAL        0                       0

```
select id , base , case
when base is NOT NULL then "Provided"
when base is NULL then "Not Provided"
end as base_status from Calculations;
```

**Question 4**
---
--Write a SQL query to remove rows from the table 'customer' with the following condition -

1. 'cust_city' should begin with the letter 'L',

```
delete from Customer where cust_city like "L%";
```

**Output:**

**Question 5**
---
-- Write a SQL statement to Double the salary for employees in department 20 who have a job_id ending with 'MAN'


Employees table

---------------
employee_id
first_name
last_name
email
phone_number
hire_date
job_id
salary
commission_pct
manager_id
department_id 


```
update Employees set salary = salary * 2 where department_id = 20 and job_id like "%MAN"
```

**Output:**

**Question 6**
---
-- Paste Question 6 hereWrite a SQL query to calculate the discounted price for each product. Return product_id, original_price, discount_percentage, and discounted_price.

Sample table: Products

product_id | original_price | discount_percentage
