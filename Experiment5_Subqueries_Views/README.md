# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```
**Question 1**
--
-- Write a query to display all the customers whose ID is the difference between the salesperson ID of Mc Lyon and 2001.

salesman table

name             type
---------------  ---------------
salesman_id      numeric(5)
name                 varchar(30)
city                    varchar(15)
commission       decimal(5,2)

customer table

name         type
-----------  ----------
customer_id  int
cust_name    text
city         text
grade        int
salesman_id  int

```sql
-- select * from customer where customer_id = (
select salesman_id from salesman where name = 'Mc Lyon' 
)-2001;
```

```sql
-- select ord_no , purch_amt , ord_date , customer_id , salesman_id from Orders where salesman_id in (
select salesman_id from Salesman where city = 'London' 
);
```

**Output:**

**Question 3**
---
-- From the following tables, write a SQL query to find all the orders issued by the salesman 'Paul Adam'. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id and salesman_id.

```sql
-- select * from Orders where salesman_id in (
select salesman_id from Salesman where name = 'Paul Adam'
);
```

**Question 4**
---
-- Write a SQL query that retrieves the names of students and their corresponding grades, where the grade is equal to the maximum grade achieved in each subject.

Sample table: GRADES

```sql
-- select student_name , grade from GRADES where (subject ,grade) in (select subject , MAX(grade)
from GRADES group by subject);
```

**Output:**

**Question 5**
---
-- Write a SQL query to Retrieve the medications with dosages equal to the highest dosage

Medications Table

```sql
-- select * from Medications where dosage = (select max(dosage) from Medications);
```

**Output:**

**Question 6**
---
-- Write a SQL query that retrieves the names of students and their corresponding grades, where the grade is equal to the minimum grade achieved in each subject.

Sample table: GRADES

```sql
-- select student_name , grade from GRADES where (subject,grade) in (select subject, min(grade) from GRADES
group by subject);
```
